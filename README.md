# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). This project helped me practice responsive design, using Flexbox for layout, and enhancing my understanding of HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to implement a mobile-first design, used Flexbox for the layout, and refined my CSS skills. I also became more comfortable with Git for version control.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing Flexbox and working on making my design responsive. In future projects, I plan to experiment with CSS Grid and explore more advanced responsive design techniques.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - A great resource for learning CSS techniques.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The Mozilla Developer Network is my go-to for documentation.
